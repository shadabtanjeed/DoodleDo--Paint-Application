## Big Issue

The FXML file does not sync up when merging branches. If you ever need to change the layout, make change in main branch
first, then notify other members to pull the changes.

# Notes

## General Notice:

1. If you are doing any changes, please update the md file. __Mention the feature under your name__
1. Before starting any coding, search this DevNotes to see if anyone is already working on it.
1. Dont work on *main*. Work on own branch and merge when completed. After work completed, delete unnecessary branches.
1. Try to use as much comments as possible and follow javadoc conventions.

## Genereal ToDo

1. Rectangular Area Erase
1. Import Image
1. Shapes
1. Text
1. Button pressed `Ctrl+Draw`
1.
